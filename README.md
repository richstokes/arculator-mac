My attempt at getting arculator to compile and run successfully on MacOS.  

Try `./mac-install.sh` -- read through the script first, since it installs a bunch of packages, to make sure you're happy with what it will do.

Now compiles and runs, but does not load menus correctly. Looking into that next.
